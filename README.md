# lifetime
Lifetime helps you to simply control your labour time. It will determinate your overtime and the hours you have to work for this day. The protocollfunction will give you the possibility to log your labour time for weeks.

This project moved from https://sourceforge.net/projects/lifetime/ here to github. 

This has 2 major reasons. 

1. The code should be at a place where it is more attractive to find additional contributors.
2. More a personal thing. I want to learn to work with git and with a big repository server,

The first release here will be lifetime 3. As a first this will have less features than lifetime 2.

Changed stuff from lifetime 2:

- Translations removed
- Removed plugin interface (Since it did not compile anymore under new QT)
- Moved to QT 5.9

Feel free to create issues or pull requests for lifetime.
